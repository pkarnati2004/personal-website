                                        <p class="mb-30">It's always been a tradition to get a Tres Leches cake for my sister's birthday (if we can find one in the part of the world we are on that day), but for obvious reasons, we weren't able to go to the store to buy
                                            one. So I decided to try my hand at making one of these from scratch. I think the most daunting part of this honestly was the whole "3 milks" ordeal and the fact that every piece of this cake I've ever had in
                                            my life has had the most smooth, moist, spongy flavor. I wanted to try to get it as close as possible but also not spend hours on the cake either, and I had to do it with the limited ingredients we had in our
                                            fridge.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="mb-30">I looked around for an easy way out and found <a href="https://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/tres-leches-cake/dee59db0-b964-4002-a5c9-fca08e2ed830">this Shortcut Tres Leches Cake</a> recipe. The issue with the recipe
                                            is that in most cases, it needs evaporated milk, which we didn't have. Thankfully, this receipe allows you to substitute whole milk for evaporated milk. In the end, the "three milks" in the cake ended up being
                                            condensed milk, whole milk, and heavy whipping cream, which we had. The recipe from the website, modified to fit my needs with my comment, is below:</p>

                                                <li>water, oil, and eggs as called for in the cake mix recipe</li>
                                                <li>2 teaspoons vanilla</li>
                                                <li>(14 oz) sweetened condensed milk (not evaporated)</li>
                                                <li>1 cup whole milk or evaporated milk</li>
                                                <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <h6>Directions</h6>
                                            <p>1. Heat oven to 350°F (325°F for dark or nonstick pan). Spray bottom and sides of 13x9-inch pan with cooking spray</p>
                                            <p>2. In large bowl, beat cake mix, water, oil, vanilla and eggs with electric mixer. Pour into pan.</p>
                                            <p>3. Bake as directed on box for 13x9-inch pan. Let stand 5 minutes. Poke top of hot cake every 1/2 inch with long-tined fork, wiping fork occasionally to reduce sticking. Really make sure that you wait for the
                                                cake to cool to poke holes in the cake or you might remove the top layer on accident.</p>
                                            <p>4. In large bowl, stir together sweetened condensed milk, whole milk and whipping cream. Carefully pour evenly over top of cake. Cover; refrigerate about 1 hour or until mixture is absorbed into cake. I left
                                                it in the fridge for 2 hours.</p>

                                        <p class="mb-30">While the cake was cooling in the fridge and the milk mixture was setting in, I looked up some frosting recipes. I have a new favorite cream cheese frosting recipe that tastes god on almost everything, so I decided
                                            to use that. It's pretty simple and a quick way to make frosting if you don't have any with ingredients in your kitchen, so it worked out great for me. You can find a pretty simple one like <a href="https://sugarspunrun.com/cream-cheese-frosting/"> this one</a>.
                                            Most call for powdered sugar, which I don't have. So, in order to make do, I just put half the amount of granulated sugar in a spice blender to make powdered sugar, which actually turned out so nice. Most recipes
                                            also call for a lot of sugar, which is way too sweet for our family, so I reduced the amount of sugar used.
                                        </p>

                                                <li>1/4-1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter softened (less if you don't want it super buttery - 1/4 works well)</li>

                                                    grind it in a spice grinder or very finely in a food processor.</li>

                                            <p>1. Combine butter and cream cheese in a bowl with an electric mixer until creamy, while combined, and lump free.</p>
                                            <p>2. Add vanilla and mix well. </p>
                                            <p>3. Put the mixer on low and gradually add sugar until well mixed. Be careful not to let the mixture splatter.</p>
                                            <p><b>Whipped Cream</b></p>
                                            <p>1. Unrelated, whisk the heavy cream on high speed until it turns into whipped cream. For me, this took about 10 minutes, and I ended up breaking our electric mixer in the process! R.I.P to my beautiful electric
                                                mixer.

                                        <p class="mb-30">After the tres leches cake cooled, I first spread the cream cheese frosting on top of the cake very evenly. Then, I put the whipped cream on top, which added a really nice touch to the cake. To finish it off, I
                                            added sliced bananas, blueberries, and raspberries on top. I even used blueberries to make a cute little 20 for the lil sis :-)</p>
                                        <p class="mb-30">The cake was a hit! I'll definitely be making this in the future :-)</p>
